# small_data
This code runs Lasso Regression to look for key drivers of a target variable in a small data set. 
There is an excel file that contains 18 input fields and 3 target data fields related to 10 companies.
One of the three target fields, "stock price", has a signal. The other two targets, as well as the inputs, are random.
You can see the details of how this file was generated in the helper file, create_excel_file.py.
The pngs show the feature inputs that the Lasso regression has found. The couple needles in the small haystack.
Compare the "stock price" results with the "rating" and "followers" tests.
